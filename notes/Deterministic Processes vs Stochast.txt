Deterministic Processes vs Stochastic processes

- Stochastic processes involves randomness
- stationary processes are independent of time
- Randomness can be predictable also
- Give example of throwing two dice, add the number and generating the time series
- Markovian process: The next state depends only on the current state, not the entire history
- Pizza, Berger, Sandwich. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3AkTO9HLXo. Use the die example

- Deterministic systems can also be non-stationary. take a + b *t. No error term
- The properties of this are non-stationary
- There are stationary and non-stationary Markov chains
- Stationarity is a separate property from the Markov property
- When time influences the generation process, they become non-stationary
- To achieve stability, the process would take some time
- De-trending is a common method used to remove one type of non-stationarity (deterministic trend)
- The purpose is to remove a deterministic trend and a stationary residue
- Scale free processes can be stationary or non-stationary
- Subtraction of mean eliminates the global trend. But, this does not change the spectral properties except the DC offset or the 0 Hz
- Give the example of random walk as an intuition for stationary probabilistic process
- This is a memory less process
- Explain why we do cumulative sum (to get it in random walk style)
- Envelope is like trend in the data
